# Portfolio
This is my portfolio website. The current master branch is the old version of my portfolio. It was made with simple HTML, CSS, and JS. The updated version is on the ["Big update branch"](https://github.com/IsmailYaman/Portfolio/tree/the-big-update) I've chosen to use NextJS to develop it because I wanted to learn a new React framework.

I'm working on this project when I have free time (which is quite rare these days), so it won't be done anytime soon :)
